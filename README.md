#### _JavaScript Implementation, 03/27/20_

  

#### By _**Sean Downs**_

  

## Description

  

_Choose Your Code Adventure is asking a few simple questions to determine what programming language one should start learning. This is an exercise in what I've learned during the 2nd week of Epicodus._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Chrome ver 10

## Known Bugs

  

_JQuery toggleShow is used but had a hard time with button placement. Background image repeats in an undesirable manner. Border radius on img class is rounding bottom corners differently than top and I can't seem to figure out why. CSS styles class got a little unorganized. Resizing the window also has undesirable effects. It enlarges the p tag in the column. Couldn't implement one javascript function to close previously opened div in the #respone. Didn't use id name #response because was causing unknown issues, used respone instead_
